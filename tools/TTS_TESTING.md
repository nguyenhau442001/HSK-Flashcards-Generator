# HSK1 prebuilt-audio test

The published HSK1 clips use `FunAudioLLM/Fun-CosyVoice3-0.5B-2512`. The older
Qwen generator remains available for comparison, but it is not the production engine.

Install CosyVoice3 from its official repository in a separate Python 3.10 environment.
Large source and model directories stay outside this repository:

```bash
python3.10 -m venv .venv-cosyvoice
git clone --recursive https://github.com/FunAudioLLM/CosyVoice.git /path/to/CosyVoice
.venv-cosyvoice/bin/pip install 'setuptools<81' wheel numpy==1.26.4 cython
.venv-cosyvoice/bin/pip install --no-build-isolation -r /path/to/CosyVoice/requirements.txt
.venv-cosyvoice/bin/python -c "from huggingface_hub import snapshot_download; snapshot_download('FunAudioLLM/Fun-CosyVoice3-0.5B-2512', local_dir='/path/to/Fun-CosyVoice3-0.5B-2512')"
```

Generate the production HSK1 set with a fixed zero-shot reference voice:

```bash
.venv-cosyvoice/bin/python tools/generate_hsk_audio_cosyvoice.py \
  --level hsk1 \
  --cosyvoice-root /path/to/CosyVoice \
  --model-dir /path/to/Fun-CosyVoice3-0.5B-2512 \
  --prompt-audio /path/to/reference.wav \
  --prompt-text 'Exact transcript of the reference audio' \
  --kind both --overwrite
```

Pronunciation inpainting overrides live in
`database/prebuilt_audio/hsk1/cosyvoice_overrides.json`. ID 63, for example, uses
`对不<strong>[q][ǐ]</strong>！没关系。` to force and emphasize `qǐ`.

## Legacy Qwen workflow

The web app can use generated MP3 files for HSK1 and automatically fall back to
the Web Speech API when a clip or manifest entry is missing.

## 1. Validate the generation plan

This uses only the Python standard library:

```bash
python3 tools/generate_hsk_audio.py --level hsk1 --dry-run
```

HSK1 should report 150 rows and 300 planned clips.

## 2. Create an isolated Python 3.12 environment

The system Python may be newer than the versions supported by PyTorch/Qwen.
Using `uv` keeps the model runtime separate from the static app:

```bash
uv venv --python 3.12 .venv-qwen-tts
uv pip install --python .venv-qwen-tts/bin/python -r tools/requirements-tts.txt
```

On a CUDA machine, optionally install FlashAttention according to the Qwen3-TTS
documentation and add `--flash-attention` to the generation command.

## 3. Generate a small sample first

Generate the first five rows (ten clips):

```bash
.venv-qwen-tts/bin/python tools/generate_hsk_audio.py \
  --level hsk1 \
  --limit 5 \
  --device cuda:0
```

For a CPU smoke test, replace `cuda:0` with `cpu`. CPU and Apple Silicon MPS may
be substantially slower or encounter unsupported model operations; a CUDA machine
is the recommended path for the complete HSK1 batch.

The script writes:

```text
database/prebuilt_audio/hsk1/
├── manifest.json
├── words/0001.mp3
└── examples/0001.mp3
```

It does not overwrite valid MP3 files unless `--overwrite` is supplied. Re-run the
same command after an interruption to resume.

Qwen can vary its speaking cadence between generations. The pipeline keeps sampling
enabled, supplies the stored pinyin as a pronunciation guide, and validates output
duration against the expected syllable count. Greedy generation can be enabled with
`--deterministic`, but may choose an incorrect phoneme. Both clip kinds remain at
their native `1.0x` tempo; values can be changed with `--word-tempo` and
`--example-tempo`. Pause compaction is disabled
by default because aggressive silence removal can make Mandarin phrasing unnatural;
enable it only for a problematic batch with `--compact-example-pauses`.

Word and example clips receive dynamic instructions derived from their pinyin fields.
Use `--no-pinyin-guide` only for troubleshooting.

## 4. Test in the browser

```bash
python3 -m http.server 8000
```

Open `http://localhost:8000/flashcards.html`, select HSK1, and test both speaker
buttons. Entries in `manifest.json` use MP3; all other entries continue using Web
Speech fallback.

After the first five rows pass review, generate all 300 HSK1 clips:

```bash
.venv-qwen-tts/bin/python tools/generate_hsk_audio.py \
  --level hsk1 \
  --device cuda:0
```

Review isolated words against their pinyin before publishing, especially
polyphonic characters. To regenerate one range, use `--start-id` together with
`--overwrite`; without `--overwrite`, already generated clips remain untouched.
